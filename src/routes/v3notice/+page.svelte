<h2>v3 Notice!</h2>

<p>I have received quite the traffic in v2, <i>I am super happy about that</i></p>
<br />
<p>
  Unfortunately, even though I wanted to, I couldn't fully implement all the features of v2 before
  launch, I hurried a lot
</p>
<br />
<p>
  I have began work on v3 now, this time it will be a full fledged app with all the features from
  start, <b>and not break any important features after launch</b>
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Developing v3 will take a long time <i>(~2 months)</i>, but if there are some important features
  that you guys wish to have in v2, feel free to open an issue on the
  <a class="link text-accent" href="https://github.com/WhyAsh5114/MyFit/issues">GitHub repository</a
  >
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The reason I am working on v3 and not implementing the new features directly in v2 is cause of
  potential migration problems, v3's schema will be different from v2's. Don't worry though, I will
  definitely make a migration script after v3 has finished development for an easy upgrade to v3
</p>
<br />
<p>Some new features that I'm working on in v3 are:</p>
<ul class="list-disc ml-5">
  <li>Offline support</li>
  <li>Automatic recovery suggestions</li>
  <li>Automatic deload creator</li>
  <li>Better and <i>working</i> analytics</li>
